        "  According to https://www.machinemetrics.com/blog/the-real-cost-of-downtime-in-manufacturing, The cost of unplanned downtime due to mechanical machine failure can be as much as $260,000 an hour. Being able to manage machine maintainance, avoiding downtime while also avoiding costly over maintainance is critical to any manufacturing operation. The ability to predict needed mainainance base on real world data rather can prescriptive studies from OEMs would bring huge savings in both time and capital to the manufactoring industry. Though much has been discussed and researched in this area such as in the link https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-implement-machine-learning-for-predictive-maintenance-4633cdbe4860. This particular student has not seen nay successful implimentation of a predictive maintainence schedule that is base on anything other than manufacturer recomendations. Though anecdotal, this experience spans over twenty years and covers four seperate, highly technical hardware dependent industries, \n",

The goal is to develop a machine learing based tool that will predict the type of maintainence required based on the data provided from the data set.
